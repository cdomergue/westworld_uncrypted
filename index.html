                        <p>Unbelievable. How did this get past legal? This is literally the same artwork that stupid (but gifted) fanboy schmuck was peddling on the internet. Pretty fitting that corporate automatically crowns Mr. Kissass as savior when all he did was steal designs to make a poster about new ideas. Ready to tell everyone to “cultivate” these chestnuts.</p>

                            <br>A thing to consider – we’ve got a huge event coming up on October 9, so it’s not the ideal time to have bad press. We’d be in the news cycle for twice as long … especially since the kid’s poster is actually pretty good. I very much like the way the landscape seems to come from the eye, like it’s both an input and an output.</p>

                        <p>You've got to be fucking kidding me... This has his stink all over it. We were clear with these guys. Admissions are up, but families are down. Strategy wants a family based spot. Not some arthouse approach. Besides, Strategy is nervous that the perception of the park is just guns and sex. Big turn-off for newer guests. How about something for kids? Horses and farmers and some wholesome shit.</p>

                        <p>Hi Elsie,
                            <br>
                            <br>I’ve noticed a pattern with repaired hosts received from Livestock Management that I now believe is worth your attention. Many Body Shop techs are neglecting to properly reboot hosts to diagnostic mode, which in of itself is not of great consequence, but it does begin to chip away at our time the more it happens.
                            <br>
                            <br>I understand that the pace of getting hosts prepped and ready to go back into rotation sometimes means that things slip through the cracks, but this should not be one of those things. I imagine they would have an issue if Intake didn’t bother to fully wipe the hosts down before receiving them, so let’s be respectful of the process.</p>

                            <br>Hello, all -
                            <br>
                            <br>As you know, the Annual Costume Department giveaway is coming up. I know we all look forward to this event, and many of us enjoy sending home keepsakes to our families and friends.
                            <br>
                            <br>However – I do not believe we have addressed the institutional issues that led to last year’s riot, and I would like to suggest we do not hold the giveaway this year. It would be more appropriate if this event were cancelled by QA and not the Costume Department, because I do think many people will be disappointed. But we just can’t have that kind of disruption on our floor again; it was not only a safety concern, but also put us days behind on our usual workload.
                            <br>
                            <br>Many thanks for considering, Farrah Watkins</p>

Apologies if this appears obvious to most of you, understanding this distinction shouldn’t be brain surgery. But you know what is brain surgery? The job of the Behavior department.

                            <br>I’m writing to file an official complaint against the goons in the Props Department who have tried to initiate a “prank war” with Host Manufacturing. As you know, we are their direct rivals in the Delos Rugby Intramural League, and they’re trying to “kick the season off with a bang.”
                            <br>
                            <br>Last night between the hours of 4 am and 5 am, they poured blue dye into the host manufacturing liquid, which meant that my team has had to spend the entire day cleaning out the tanks. I cannot even begin to describe how backed up we are with work today.
                            <br>
                            <br>I attempted to speak to Cesar Donovan in Props, and his response was, “Blue looks more badass anyway.”
                            <br>
                            <br>Please handle, as I don’t have the patience or bandwidth. Thank you in advance.

                            <br>This is your first notice, informing you that you have failed your Living Quarters inspection and have been cited for general uncleanliness.

                            <br>A second review of your quarters will happen sometime over the next two weeks, and QA reserves the right to conduct this inspection without your prior knowledge. Should your quarters pass inspection during this second review, no further action will be necessary. However, should your quarters again fail to live up to the standard of a Delos employee, you will receive an official citation.
                            <br>

                        <p>Hello, all –
                            <br>
                            <br>In case you are unaware (though I can’t imagine why you would be) – it is not absolutely necessary for Intake to cut up and discard all host costumes that have been damaged parkside. The Costume Department is perfectly capable of repairing clothes that have only received minor damage, and they can even patch most bullet holes. Therefore, please only incinerate clothing that is absolutely beyond reasonable repair. Otherwise, we can all save costs by being more frugal and resourceful. With the current round of budget cuts, it would behoove us all to work together in this. I understand we’re all pressed for time, but this is important.
                            <br>

                        <p>Far be it from me to tell you guys how to do your jobs but – several hosts in the Bloody Benders storyline were shot in the face by a QA Security Response team in Sector 23.
                            <br>
                            <br>Some of the hosts are homicidal by design, but they cannot hurt humans. In this instance, the three hosts in question are designed to rush headlong at “victims,” but no employee was in any real danger.
                            <br>
                            <br>Just asking that you remind your team to use voice commands first and shoot as a last resort. This latest trigger-happy response has led to some unnecessary costs, since we have to now rebuild the hosts’ cortical shields from scratch.

                        <p>Corporate conducted a focus group to evaluate our effectiveness at drawing guests in the 25-35 age range based out of Eastern Europe.

                            <br>Attached are their findings and suggestions for narratives that appeal to this sector of the population. They’re looking for a 30% increase in engagement from this group within the next year.

                        <p>Team: You may have heard media reports about recent attempts to breach IT security around Westworld’s digital properties and servers. As employees, we would like to make sure you have the facts about what happened and the steps we all need to take to protect sensitive Delos information. In the past couple weeks, users of online digital message boards have been looking closely at the source code behind Westworld’s digital destinations, particularly DiscoverWestworld.com, looking for details about our operations. Thankfully, those users have gleaned little, but we know they are continually watching. Considering this and the fact that code can get messy, it’s imperative all Westworld staffers take the time to comb through all public-facing code and remove any sensitive materials or links that may be inadvertently embedded within. The company does not want to take chances with exposing proprietary information.
                            <br>
                            <br>If you have any questions, contact our Data Security &amp; Protection team. As always, please keep this information and request confidential.

                        <p>Team: Narrative has been working on a promo for the new Fall storylines in the park. Delos Strategy group has the usual concerns about hitting their quadrants, reach, appeal, etc. We're confident they'll sign off. While this is not approved or public yet, the management team thought it pertinent to begin sharing with WW employees as early as possible to grow awareness of the exciting changes coming. This is confidential and for internal review ONLY. Take a look at what's in the works here.
